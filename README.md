# sarakina_victims_pipeline

These are the post-mapache bash scripts used to perform analyses in the paper of Psonis et al. 2023.
They are separated into two main pipelines, one fo the living relatives (to be performed first) and a second for the victims.

The scripts are provided for the shake of reprodusability of the results, but also for free use by the scientific community.
Note though that I do not intend to maintain this repository and hence I may not reply to reporting issues.

I also include the samplelist and the two config files of mapache (for the two runs, with and without bamutil).
